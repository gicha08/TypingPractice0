I like to make a game using just a HTML file to let user pracice typing.  Here is my idea.

English words are generated and fall from the top of the screen (considered 'sky') at a certain speed. There is an input area where user should type the words before they fall to the ground. If a word falls to the ground, you lose a life. If you lose 5 lives, the game is over.

Can you have multiple stages start from stage 1. In low stages, words are short and easy to type. Each stage about 30 words are generated. As you clear a stage, congratulate and move on the next stage. Words are harder and longer. How about having 10 stages?

Can you let the user select the stage to start from? And generate a little more diverse words please.

Can you use just one list of words in increasing difficulty level and select a word in earlier part of the list on early stages and select a word in later part of the list on later stages? That way you may have words with mixed difficulty in each stage.

(additional prompt in chatGPT)
Can you decrease the spawnRate a bit?
