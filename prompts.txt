(in chatGPT)
I like to make a game using just a HTML file to let user pracice typing.  Here is my idea.

English words are generated and fall from the top of the screen (considered 'sky') at a certain speed. There is an input area where user should type the words before they fall to the ground. If a word falls to the ground, you lose a life. If you lose 5 lives, the game is over.

Can you have multiple stages start from stage 1. In low stages, words are short and easy type. Each stage about 30 words are generated. As you clear a stage, congratulate and move on the next stage. Words are harder and longer. How about having 10 stages?

Can you let the user select the stage to start from? And generate a little more diverse words please.
